# grandeomega-MacOS-app



Tired of having to open terminal? 

With this app you can now use spotlight to launch grande omega, and it will work with any version!

Instructions:

Clone or download this repository

You can clone by typing ```git clone https://github.com/dvdzmr/grandeomega-MacOS-app.git``` whilst in your preferred folder. 

I suggest typing ```cd Downloads``` first if you are not familiar with the terminal, that way this folder shows up in your downloads folder.

After that simply drag the 'GrandeOmega.app' into your applications folder. 

Make sure that you download Grande Omega from the official website, and then put that inside a folder simply called 'grandeomega' in Documents.

This is how it should look like:

Everytime there is an update, simply remove and replace this folder with the new version. 

If i have time in a future version ill add an auto updater that will do this by itself.
